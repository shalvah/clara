Simple, pretty, testable console output for PHP CLI apps.

## Installation
(PHP 7.2+)

```bash
composer require shalvah/clara
```

## Using Clara
```php
$output = clara('myappname');

$output->info("Installing package");
$output->debug("Attempt 3 of 5");
$output->warn("The file does not exist.");
$output->error("Something went wrong!");
$output->success("Done. Go and be awesome.");
```

The output will be coloured and presented as in the screenshot shown above.

If you'd like to output a line of text without the extra formatting provided by the functions above, you can use the `$output->line()` method instead.

## Toggling debug output
It's conventional to include a verbose flag (`-v`) in your CLI app that lets you show additional (debug) output to the user. You could then check for the value of the flag in an if-statement before outputting any debug logs. Clara makes this easier by letting you choose whether debug logs are on or not:

```php
$isVerbose = $this->getFlag('v');

// If $isVerbose is true,// 
// Clara won't print or capture any debug logs
$app1 = clara('app1', $isVerbose); 
$app1->debug("App 1 - Output 1");

// You can also toggle debug output manually at any time
$app1->showDebugOutput();
$app1->debug("App 1 - Output 2");

$app1->hideDebugOutput();
$app1->debug("App 1 - Output 3");
```

Note that by default (if you do not pass a second parameter to `clara()` or call the toggle methods), Clara will show all output.

## Muting output
Sometimes when running your app's tests, you don't want to clutter your console with the output messages. You can turn off Clara's output by using the `mute()` and `unmute` static methods. To mute or unmute a specific app, pass in the app name.

```php
$output1 = clara('myapp1');
$output2 = clara('myapp2');

Clara::mute('myapp1'); // Mute only output from "myapp1"
// Won't be printed.
$output1->info("Installing package");

// Will be printed
$output2->info("Installing package");

Clara::mute(); // Mute all apps
Clara::unmute("myapp1"); // Unmute myapp1
Clara::unmute(); // Unmute all apps
```

## Showing only your app's output. 
Imagine your app includes another app that uses Clara. By default, the output from all apps would be shown. You can turn off output for all apps but yours by calling `->only()`.

```php
// SHow only output from mymainapp
$output1 = clara('mymainapp')->only();

// This is equivalent to doing:
Clara::mute();
Clara::unmute('yourappname');
```

## Capturing the output
Sometimes you need to assert that your app printed what you expect. An easy way is to use output capturing.

```php
Clara::startCapturingOutput('myapp1'); // Clara will start capturing output from myapp1
$output1 = clara('myapp1');
$output1->warn("Going to fail");
$output1->error("Failed");

$capturedOutput = Clara::getCapturedOutput('myapp1');
// $capturedOutput = [
//   "<fg=yellow>ðŸš¸ warning</> Going to fail",
//   "<fg=red>ðŸš« error</> Failed",
// ]

Clara::stopCapturingOutput('myapp1');
Clara::clearCapturedOutput('myapp1'); // Will empty saved output
``` 

You can reset the entire state of Clara to default by calling `Clara::reset()`. This will clear captured output, stop capturing for all apps and unmute all apps.

## Setting an output channel
By default, Clara outputs to the console, but you can actually output to somewhere else. This is helpful if you're writing a Laravel Artisan command and want to use Clara for output while still capturing the output via Artisan's `->output()` method. All you need to do is call `useOutput` with an instance of `Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface` (for Artisan classes, it's `$this`).

```php

$this->clara = clara('myapp', $shouldBeVerbose)
  ->useOutput($this)
  ->only();
```
 
## Note on emoji support
Some environments (example: Windows console) don't have proper support for Unicode, so emojis may not display properly.
